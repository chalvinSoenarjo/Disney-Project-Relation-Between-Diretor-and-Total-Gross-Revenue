    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Disney, one of the world's most iconic entertainment companies, has a rich history of producing beloved films that have not only captured the hearts of audiences but also achieved remarkable success at the box office. In this analysis, we delve into the world of Disney movies, with a specific focus on determining the top 10 highest-grossing Disney movies of all time. Additionally, we aim to identify and recognize the directors who have been most successful in terms of generating box office revenue for Disney.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question(s) of Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "The central question that drives this investigation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"What are the top 10 highest-grossing Disney movies of all time, and which directors have been most successful in terms of box office revenue? And is there a relationship between director and total gross revenue\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This question is compelling for several reasons. Firstly, it allows us to explore the financial success of Disney's films, which is a key indicator of their popularity and cultural impact. Secondly, understanding which directors have been most successful in terms of box office revenue sheds light on the individuals who have played a pivotal role in Disney's cinematic achievements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disney's extensive filmography includes classics like \"The Lion King,\" \"Aladdin,\" and modern hits like \"Frozen\" and \"The Avengers\" series (through Disney's acquisition of Marvel). Each of these films represents a significant contribution to Disney's legacy, and this analysis seeks to highlight the top performers in terms of box office success.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this analysis was obtained from [Data World](https://data.world/kgarrett/disney-character-success-00-16) and comprises two main datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **disney_movies_total_gross.csv**: This dataset contains comprehensive information about Disney movies. It includes details such as the movie title, release year, and the total gross revenue generated at the box office. With this dataset, we can identify the highest-grossing Disney movies, providing valuable insights into the financial success of each film.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **disney-director.csv**: This dataset provides a wealth of information about the directors of Disney movies. It includes the names of directors and the specific movies they have directed within the Disney catalog. This dataset is crucial for attributing the success of movies to the directors responsible for their creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of these datasets enables us to explore and answer our research question comprehensively. We will perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data accuracy and consistency. Subsequently, we will delve into data exploration and analysis to identify the top 10 highest-grossing Disney movies and the directors who have played a pivotal role in Disney's box office revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the analysis, we will employ data visualization techniques to present our findings in an accessible and informative manner. The results will provide a deeper understanding of Disney's cinematic achievements and the influential directors who have contributed to the company's legacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This investigation, driven by data science, will contribute to our appreciation of Disney's film history and the impact of individual directors on the financial success of Disney movies.\n"

    "# Discussion: Exploring Disney Movie Gross Revenue and Directors\n",
    "In this analysis, we embarked on a journey to explore Disney's movie dataset, shedding light on the performance of Disney movies and the directors who brought them to life. Our investigation began by merging two datasets: one containing information about Disney movies and the other focusing on directors and their respective total gross revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial objective was to identify the top 10 highest-grossing Disney movies. To accomplish this, we sorted the dataset by total gross revenue in descending order, unveiling a list dominated by timeless classics such as \"The Lion King\" and modern hits like \"Frozen.\" The diverse mix of adventure, musical, and comedy genres underscored the wide-ranging appeal of Disney's film portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we encountered a data formatting challenge. The 'total_gross' column was not in a numeric format, impeding our ability to conduct numerical operations. To address this issue, we removed non-numeric characters and converted the 'total_gross' column to a numeric format, an essential step for further analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, our efforts to create a bar chart to visualize the top 10 movies by total gross revenue were met with an unexpected issue. It came to our attention that the 'total_gross' column remained in a non-numeric format. After investigating the data types, we discovered that the 'inflation_adjusted_gross' column was mistakenly categorized as an object type instead of numeric. Rectifying this oversight allowed us to create an informative bar chart, showcasing the top 10 highest-grossing Disney movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delving deeper into our analysis, we focused on exploring the relationship between the top-grossing movies and their directors. We generated a DataFrame featuring the top 10 directors with the highest total gross revenue and calculated the correlation coefficient between these two sets of data. This correlation assessment aimed to unveil potential connections between directorial choices and box office success.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, our analysis offers valuable insights into the performance of Disney movies and the influence of directors. It highlights the enduring success of classics like \"The Lion King\" alongside the prosperity of newer releases like \"Frozen.\" The data challenges we encountered underscore the significance of data cleaning and formatting in ensuring accurate and meaningful analyses. Furthermore, the correlation analysis paves the way for future investigations into how directorial decisions impact a movie's financial success.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis serves as a foundation for further research in the realm of film production and provides a glimpse into the intricate world of Disney's cinematic achievements. It underscores the dynamic interplay between creative storytelling, directorial choices, and the financial outcomes of Disney's cinematic endeavors."

    "# Expectations on findings\n",
    "The analysis in the notebook aims to identify the top 10 highest-grossing Disney movies and recognize the directors who have contributed to Disney's success in terms of box office revenue. The analysis begins by cleaning and preprocessing the data, addressing missing values and data types, and then merging the datasets. Subsequently, it identifies the top 10 highest-grossing Disney movies and the directors associated with them. It also provides visualizations of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings include the top 10 highest-grossing Disney movies, with \"The Lion King,\" \"Frozen,\" and \"The Jungle Book\" being among the top earners. The analysis also reveals the directors who have contributed significantly to Disney's box office revenue, with Wolfgang Reitherman, Ron Clements, and Chris Buck being the top directors.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings align with what one might expect, as these movies are well-known Disney classics and have been highly successful at the box office. The involvement of renowned directors in Disney's success is also in line with industry expectations, as experienced directors often play a crucial role in a film's performance."

    "# Other questions unanswered\n",
    "\n",
    "While the analysis addresses the top 10 highest-grossing Disney movies and the directors' contributions to Disney's success, there are other questions that one might want to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Trends Over Time: It would be interesting to analyze how Disney's top-grossing movies and directorial impact have evolved over the years. Are there specific decades or periods with a higher concentration of successful films?\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Genre Analysis: Do certain genres tend to perform better at the box office for Disney? Exploring the relationship between movie genres and box office success could provide valuable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Director Profiles: A more in-depth analysis of each director's filmography, style, and impact on individual movies could offer a comprehensive understanding of their contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Market Factors: Are there external factors, such as changes in the film industry, marketing strategies, or competition, that have influenced Disney's box office performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "e. Audience Demographics: Analyzing the demographics and preferences of the audience for Disney movies could provide insights into Disney's target market and how it has evolved over time.\n",
